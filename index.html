					<h2>Ms. Kwong</h2>
					<p>who is living in the public housing at Ma On Shan lonely, mentioned that she hasn’t
						received any benefit from the ParknShop’s give-back proposals which rolled out in October.
						Although Ms Kwong is receiving the meal preparation and different household services provided by
						the Evangelical Lutheran Church Social Service Hong Kong, she can’t receive any information
						about the give-back proposals from the social workers or the staff from the NGO.</p>
					<p>“They never ask me if I would like to apply for the ParknShop’s coupon and I don't even know
						there is an online lucky draw that everyone can join.” said Ms Kwong angrily. She mentioned that
						the publicity of the give-back proposal is not enough for example she can only receive the
						information about the proposals from the TV news only. As a result, she could not benefit from
						it and did not receive any cash coupon.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although ParknShop claims that their proposals are quantifiable and transparent enough and it
						will be targeting on underprivileged group, we can see that some elderly can’t be benefited from
						it. Can ParknShop’s proposals really provide a give-back to the customer? Especially the
						underprivileged group who affected the most under COVID-19. Is that the plan can fulfill the ESS
						requirements? If not, who needs to take the responsibility and should the ParknShop provide
						another round of give-back to the customer?

					<h2>Employment Support Scheme(ESS)</h2>
					<p>With the influence of pandemic, Hong Kong's economic environment was destroyed and the Government
						has launched the Employment Support Scheme (ESS) to provide time-limited financial support to
						employers to retain employees who may otherwise be made redundant. The two local mainstream
						supermarkets ParknShop and Welllcome had applied for the 2nd round of ESS and the Government had
						set up the specific requirements for them if they wanted to receive the subsidy.</p>
					<p>
						According to the <a
							href="https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat/sub/sp320.jsp?productCode=B1080003" target="_blank">latest Monthly
							Survey of Retail Sales</a> from the Government's Census and
						Statistics Department, the value of sales of supermarkets is increasing starting from October
						2019. The value of sales by Supermarkets increased from 4,488 million October 2019 to 5,159
						million August 2020. Moreover, as mentioned in the report, the Value index of supermarkets
						maintained a positive which means that their business is growing.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although the supermarkets industry can still make a profit under the effect of COVID-19, we
						found that ParknShop and Wellcome still applied for the 1st round of ESS and they respectively
						received 161 million and 399 million from the scheme. As a result, the Government added some
						specific requirements in their 2nd ESS application that they must provide a give-back to the
						customer.
					</p>
					<p>
						As mentioned from the <a
							href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202009/22/P2020092200807.htm?fontSize=1" target="_blank">Government
							information</a>, they required the supermarts to admit three
						requirements which include use not be less than 50 percent of the subsidies in the rebate,
						should be quantifiable and transparent and the beneficiaries of the rebate should mainly focus
						on the underprivileged groups and the customer before accept the subsidies.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the beginning of October, ParknShop announced their give-back proposals that included three
						main rebate plans for example Online Lucky Draw, Cash Food Coupons and Providing Discount on
						Certain Products. However, the details of those plans were too inconvenient for the elderly and
						also the underprivileged group. In the following part, we will discuss some loopholes in the
						proposals.

					<h2>Loopholes in the Give-back Proposals: Food Coupon</h2>
					<p>
						PARKnSHOP planned to distribute cash or food vouchers to disadvantaged groups and promised to
						complete the implementation of feedback suggestions by the end of December. The government has
						asked these two chain supermarkets to disclose the list of beneficiaries, the number of
						beneficiaries, and the amount involved in a timely manner for public monitoring.
					</p>
					<p>
						Yet, with reference to the phone interview calling the 27 social welfare organizations that
						cooperate with supermarkets, we discovered that almost all of the organizations only open the
						scheme to their members, and the list of eligible members would be given to PARKnSHOP for
						further selection.
					</p>
					<p>
						With a few coupons distributed from PARKnSHOP, only limited people can receive it. However, all
						the low-income parties should have the right to receive the food coupon, but in fact, they did
						not.
					</p>
					<p>
						Besides, there is low transparency for the rundown and selection panel for the scheme. As
						mentioned above, the list and amount of beneficiaries should not be enclosed, but most of the
						organizations answered "not sure" when they were asked how many members had received the coupon.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I am not sure how many members have received the coupon since here is the headquarters and we
						don’t have the member list for all our departments,” said a staff member from Evangelical
						Lutheran Church Social Service Hong Kong.
					</p>
					<p>
						“We have our own selection system and we can’t share it to the public.” he added. This shows
						that the selection process of the food coupon is not open and it can’t fulfill the requirement
						from the Government.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I have never heard of any information about the ParknShop proposals from the staff member of
						Evangelical Lutheran Church Social Service.” said Ms, Kwong. She is not informed by the
						organizations that she is eligible to apply for the PARKnSHOP food coupon. The promotion of
						PARKnSHOP is not extensive enough. The event is designed to help low-income people. However, the
						target customers do not know that they can join, which is a waste of time.
					</p>
					<p>
						ParknShop responded that they have a system to monitor the whole program and they will review
						all the applications based on their income, living environment etc. However, due to privacy
						reasons, they can’t share with us the details of the selection. They will provide the whole list
						to the government when the program is finished.

					<h2>Loopholes in the Give-back Proposals: Lucky Draw</h2>
					<p>
						Participants only need to provide their valid mobile phone number and date of birth to
						participate in the "Reward You" lucky draw. It means that not only the Hong Kong residents can
						join, but almost all of the people in Hong Kong have the chance to win a prize in this lucky
						draw. It is showing that the rebate can’t focus on underprivileged people.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the famous secondhand marketplaces website: Carousell, there are so many people selling their
						coupons from the draw. Most of them may sell it at a 10% discount and mentioned that it can be
						used in any ParknShop’s shop. As shown in the picture, there is no information to prove the
						identity of the coupon owner. It means that the people can sell it easily and there is no way
						for ParknShop to trace back.
					</p>
					<p>
						How can the lower-income group gain advantages and competitiveness in this draw with this huge
						amount of participants? Also, the guidelines for the draw are not clear and there is no
						limitation on the use of coupons. It is not focusing on the needs of those underprivileged
						groups.
					</p>
					<p>
						Apart from that, the system of the lucky draw is also inconvenient for the vulnerable groups.
						Some of them are elderly and they don't even know how to apply the draw through the internet.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I knew the lucky draw, but I know nothing about computers and don’t want to annoy my son. Also,
						the PARKnSHOP’s staff told me I should ask my family and they won’t help me to register, ” said
						Ms. Kwong.
					</p>
					<p>
						For most of the people, 200 food coupons may not be so attractive, but it is so meaningful for
						the low-income families because 200 dollars can be their meal fee for two days.
					</p>
					<p>
						The requirements stated on the coupon also made Ms Kwong step back from enjoying the discount.
						As stated in the terms and conditions, if the customer purchases less than $100, there will be
						no refund. Which means that the elderly need to spend more than $100 when they want to use the
						coupon and it is really inconvenient for the eldery since they are not able to purchase lots of
						goods at once.
					</p>
					<p>
						ParknShop responded that it is the Government's requirement to provide the general public with
						unconditional cash rebate which shouldn’t be provided upon any purchase. Under COVID-19, there
						is no other better way to distribute the vouchers, except lucky draws. About the face value of
						the vouchers, in order to benefit as many general public as possible, they decided to distribute
						cash vouchers with single face value.

					<h2 style="text-align:center">Loopholes in the Give-back Proposals: <br>Price Reduction </h2>
					<p>
						The Government also requires the supermarket to announce a price reduction plan to benefit the
						customer. Yet, PARKnSHOP uses "Raised the prices of some goods before publicising extensively"
						to create the false impression of price reduction.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is an example of rice, which is sold in PARKnSHOP. In early November, its price was 102
						HKD, and increased to 105.9 HKD from 6 November to 19 November. Then, it was reduced to 102 HKD
						again from 27 November. This shows the supermarket is exploiting the loophole in the law and to
						create the illusion of price reduction.
					</p>
					<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4502345" data-height="320px"
						data-weight="320px">
						<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
					</div>
					<p>
						On the other hand, the average number of discount products is only around 12% in total. Frozen
						food is the largest proportion of discount products, which is 23.94%. However, the other
						categories are below 20%, some of them are even below 10%. Groceries, like rice and oil, had
						only 10% discounted. It is not enough to benefit the people with needs. The government has
						claimed that PARKnSHOP should have more discount after it applied the 2nd tranche of the ESS
						successfully. However, it seems like they do not spend much money from the ESS in the give-back
						proposals.
					</p>
					<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4501061" data-height="320px"
						data-weight="320px">
						<script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
					</div>
					<p>
						Moreover, there are a lot of incidental requirements required for citizens to follow in order to
						enjoy the price deduction. For example, when the supermarket intends to launch special discounts
						or price reductions, they require the citizens to purchase a certain amount of money before they
						can enjoy the discount, or the citizens are required to buy 2 or more in order to get 1 free.
						These discounts are bundled with promotion. This act is harming the interest of the lower-income
						group, especially for the elderly living alone.
					</p>
					<div class="image" style="height:800; width:900px; padding-left:250px"><a

					<p>
						The price deduction scheme aims to help the lower-income group, but the target can’t enjoy it.
						Those actions caused an increase on the price of goods and a decline in quality, which harms the
						interests of consumers and other business operators.
					</p>
					<p>
						The phenomenon of "Raised the prices of some goods before publicising extensively" is only the
						trick of the supermarkets to attract attention and loyalty from the customers, especially for
						the elderly and the lower-income group. They may think that the supermarkets are trying to help
						them in the most obvious way -- price reduction. Yet, this is a PR show for publicizing the
						company to increase its inter-corporate image.

			<div class="inner">
				<header class="major">
					<h2>"The whole Give-back Proposals just like a PR Show of ParknShop and they haven't consider the
						difficulies in our perspective"<br><br>said Ms Kwong</h2>
					<p>Although ParknShop claimed that their Give-back proposals can benefit the poor population and all
						the rebates are already approved by the Government, we can see that the plans can’t really
						target the underprivileged group. No matter the Lucky Draw or the Food Coupon, there are some
						limitations and not all the people can apply for it even though they can fulfill the
						requirements, like Ms Kwong.
					</p>
					<p>
						More importantly is that there is no monitor system on both events
						and the public doesn’t know how the money was spent. The food coupon event ended at the late
						October and ParknShop still doesn’t provide any data about the event such as Number of
						beneficiaries. The ParknShop’s Give-back proposals can’t fulfill those requirements of ESS and
						the Government should also review the effectiveness of the event in order to evaluate whether
						ParknShop should receive any penalty.
